# A Comparative Analysis of Classifiers for Medical Image Classification

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for a minor project conducted during the 6th semester by **Srijan Kumar**, **Sneha Singh** and **Jyoti Kumari**. The project focuses on performing a comparative analysis of various classifiers for medical image classification. The goal is to evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms in accurately classifying medical images, which can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases.

## Project Overview
Medical image classification plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling the identification and classification of diseases based on imaging data such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans. The objective of this project is to explore and compare different classifiers in terms of their accuracy, efficiency, and robustness for medical image classification tasks.

The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain a suitable dataset of medical images with corresponding ground truth labels. This dataset should encompass a variety of medical conditions for comprehensive analysis.

2. **Preprocessing**: Perform preprocessing techniques on the medical images to enhance their quality and remove any noise or artifacts. This step may involve resizing, cropping, denoising, and normalization.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed medical images. This can include both handcrafted features and deep learning-based feature extraction techniques.

4. **Classifier Selection**: Implement and compare multiple classifiers commonly used for image classification, such as VGG 16, VGG 19, Inception V3, Inception ResNet V2, DenseNet
121, DenseNet 201

5. **Training and Evaluation**: Train each classifier using the extracted features and evaluate their performance on the test dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score should be calculated to compare the classifiers.

6. **Analysis and Comparison**: Analyze the results obtained from different classifiers and identify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Compare their performance in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to variations in medical image data.

7. **Documentation**: Document the entire project, including the dataset description, preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, classifier implementation details, and comparative analysis results.
